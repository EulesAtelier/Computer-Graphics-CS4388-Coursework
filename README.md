# Computer Graphics (CS4388) Coursework

This repository is a collection of the published websites that host the coursework I did in Dr. Isayas Berhe Adhanom's CS4388. The course utilized TypeScript using a high-level graphics toolkit built on top of WebGL called GopherGFX.

Assignment 1: [Space Minesweeper](https://cs-4388-5388-fall-2025.github.io/assignment-1-EulesAtelier/)
- Implemented basic computer graphics concepts such as parallax and simulating movement, along with basic game logic.
Assignment 2: [Hole in the Ground](https://cs-4388-5388-fall-2025.github.io/assignment-2-EulesAtelier/)
- Learned and implemented 3D physics calculations for collisions and rendering.
Assignment 3: [Earthquake Visualization](https://cs-4388-5388-fall-2025.github.io/assignment-3-EulesAtelier/)
- Created the main mesh with code, linking the vertices and calculating the position and UV coordinates. Implemented the morphing animation through lerping between positions.
Assignment 4: [So You Think Ants Can Dance](https://cs-4388-5388-fall-2025.github.io/assignment-4-EulesAtelier/)
- Added the recursive functions for creating bones and skeletons, and created a simple model out of rudimentary shapes. Also implemented new animations from new files.
Assignment 5: Artistic Rendering (To Be Completed)

Note: The code I implemented in the coursework is available at request, however I can not publish it publicly.
